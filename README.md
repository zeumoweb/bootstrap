Front-end Development with Bootstrap

## Task Done By me 
* Fixed the Responsive property of website (Added all the CSS and JS lib in bootstrap)

## Step you need to follow while revisting the code : 

* Pull branch `subhamWork` from your repo. ----> [DONE]
* Change your branch in local system to a branch name as `errorReviewBranch` ---->  [WHERE IS YOUR `errorReviewBranch` ?]
* Check `index.html` file for all my comments and reviews. ---> `TODO TASK : ` Make those neccasary changes and save them. ---->[DONE]
* Check I have added 2 images in ` image` folder ---> `TODO TASK : ` Add  both images in the blog section maintain a satisfactory size. [image is not loading in web page ?]
* Once all the changes are done Push your branch code into gitHub Branch. [NEEDED TO BE CORRECT THOSE THINGS TOO]
